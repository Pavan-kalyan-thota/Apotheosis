Today organizations have multiple tools and systems to help assist them in their day to 
day software development activities. There is need of a system which can connect to 
applications, mine & analyze data and provide results to stakeholders whenever they need it.
Solution:
 Create an AI/ML based application to be hosted within a corporate/organization intranet 
with complete access to corporate/organization resources of JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket and 
Stack Overflow. The primary responsibility of this software robot (Apotheosis - APO) is to 
learn-mine-analyze-serve information about a product to optimize development and support 
processes in a product team. APO’s input interfaces would be a mic and email to receive input 
from users. APO’s output interfaces would be speaker and email to revert to users. 
 Following are some of the use cases.
1. Anyone can ask/look up for any information to Apo. It responds with accurate answer by 
voice-to-text conversion.
2. Mining existing data from applications using their respective APIs.
3. Co-relating multiple information, analyzing and responding to queries through text-to-
voice.
4. It records meeting MOM in detail in its own database.
5. The project manager can also instruct APO to do multiple activities during the meeting.
 To implement this we use client-server model, voice-text-voice converter,
Jira/Confluence/bitbucket/Stack overflow APIs to analyze data to get accurate information, 
ML(Machine Learning) for learning and updating itself.
